# ToDo-App-with-sub-ToDos

# Overview

For this learning experience, I wanted to make a mobile app. This was a struggle for me because from the research I did, iPhone is hard to do an app for if you don't have a Mac. I tried to find ways around it and found this ToDo app that I wanted to alter and make my own. 

For the alteration, I wanted to add subcategories to the ToDos so that a checklist can be broken down into individual tasks.

I wanted to create this app because I struggle with gettin things done and some tasks can feel overwhelming and I have a hard time starting them if I can't see them broken down.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

For this app I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, dependencies to make it appear as an app for a mobile phone.
